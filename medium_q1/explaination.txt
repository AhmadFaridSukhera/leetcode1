Question:
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive,
return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
Return the answer in any order.

Explanation
the code uses a class where the self and digits are the arguments.
the keypad stores the mobile keypad using a dictionary with each number corresponding to its alpahbets Ranging from 2 to 9.
To produce the desired result we use "for loops".
1st for loop gives us the length of the digits.
2nd loop takes us the location of the first digit while the 3rd loop helps us iterate it as we keep on appending it to the result.
finaly we return the result
